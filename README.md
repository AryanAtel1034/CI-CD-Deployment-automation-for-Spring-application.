# CI-CD-Deployment-Automation-for-Spring-Application (Devops)
-  This project aims to implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of a Spring application. Using Git for version control, Jenkins for CI, and Maven for build automation, the pipeline will include SonarQube for code quality checks, Aqua Trivy for security scanning, and Docker for containerization. Docker images will be stored in Docker Hub, and Kubernetes will manage the deployment and orchestration of the application.
